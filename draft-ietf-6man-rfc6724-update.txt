  Prioritizing known-local IPv6 ULAs through address selection policy
                   draft-ietf-6man-rfc6724-update-14

Abstract

   When RFC 6724 was published it defined an address selection algorithm
   along with a default policy table, and noted a number of examples
   where that policy table might benefit from adjustment for specific
   scenarios.  It also noted that it is important for implementations to
   provide a way to change the default policies as more experience is
   gained.  This update draws on several years of such operational
   experience to refine RFC 6724, with emphasis on preference for the
   use of ULA addresses over IPv4 addresses and the clarification of
   mandatory support for Rule 5.5.  It also defines the concept of
   "known-local" ULA prefixes and the means by which nodes can identify
   them and insert them into their policy table such that ULA-to-ULA
   communications within fd00::/8 become preferred over GUA-to-GUA for
   local use.  The update also demotes the preference for 6to4
   addresses.  These changes to default behavior improve supportability
   of common use cases, including automatic / unmanaged scenarios.  It
   is recognized that some less common deployment scenarios may require
   explicit configuration or custom changes to achieve desired
   operational parameters.

1.  Introduction

   Since its publication in 2012, [RFC6724] has become an important
   mechanism by which nodes can perform address selection, deriving the
   most appropriate source and destination address pair to use from a
   candidate set by following the procedures defined in the RFC.  Part
   of the process involves the use of a policy table, where the
   precedence and labels for address prefixes are listed, and for which
   a default policy table is defined.

   It was always expected that the default policy table may need to be
   changed based on operational experience; section 2.1 says "It is
   important that implementations provide a way to change the default
   policies as more experience is gained" and points to the examples in
   Section 10, which include Section 10.6 where a ULA example is
   presented.

   This document is written on the basis of such operational experience,
   in particular for scenarios where ULAs are used for their intended
   purpose as stated in [RFC4193], i.e., they are designed to be routed
   within a local site and by default not advertised, used or received
   from externally to that site.  The document defines how preference
   for ULAs may be elevated for appropriate, common scenarios.

   To support the preference to use ULA address pairs over GUA address
   pairs for local intra-site scenarios, the concept of a "known-local"
   ULA address is introduced.  The means for nodes to determine ULA
   prefixes that are known to be local to the site they are operating in
   and to insert those prefix(es) into their policy table is described
   in this document.  This capability allows nodes to prefer ULA-ULA
   communication locally, but still use GUA-GUA address pairs for
   external communication, and importantly avoid selecting a ULA source
   to talk to a non-local ULA destination.

   This document also reinforces the text in RFC 6724 to require support
   for Rule 5.5.

   RFC 4193 defines ULAs within fc00::/7, where the L bit, as detailed
   in Section 3.1, is set to 1 for locally assigned (generated)
   prefixes, with L=0 as yet undefined.  The use of known-locals as

   described in this document therefore applies to the currently used
   ULA prefixes under fd00::/8, where the prefixes conform to the
   definition in Section 3.1.

   The overall goal of this update is to improve behavior for common
   scenarios, and to assist in the phasing out of use of IPv4, while
   noting that some specific scenarios may still require explicit
   configuration.

   An IPv6 deployment, whether enterprise, residential or other, may use
   combinations of IPv6 GUAs, IPv6 ULAs, IPv4 globals, IPv4 RFC 1918
   addressing, and may or may not use some form of NAT.  However, this
   document makes no comment or recommendation on how ULAs are used, or
   on the use of NAT in an IPv6 network.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   GUA: Global Unicast Addressing as defined in [RFC3587]

   ULA: Unique Local Addressing as defined in [RFC4193]

   Known-local ULA: A ULA prefix that an individual organization/site
   has determined to be local to a given node/network

3.  Operational Issues Regarding Preference for IPv4 addresses over ULAs

   With multiaddressing being the norm for IPv6, moreso where nodes are
   dual-stack, the ability for a node to pick an appropriate address
   pair for communication is very important.

   Where getaddrinfo() or a comparable API is used, the sorting behavior
   should take into account both the source addresses of the requesting
   node as well as the destination addresses returned, and sort the
   candidate address pairs following the procedures defined in RFC 6724.

   The current default policy table leads to preference for IPv6 GUAs
   over IPv4 globals, which is widely considered preferential behavior
   to support greater use of IPv6 in dual-stack environments.  This
   helps allow sites to phase out IPv4 as its evidenced use becomes ever
   lower.





Buraglio, et al.           Expires 8 May 2025                   [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  Prioritizing known-local ULAs in RFC 672   November 2024


   However, there are two issues with preference, or rather non-
   preference, for ULAs as orginally defined in RFC 6724.

   One is that the same default policy table also puts IPv6 ULAs below
   all IPv4 addresses, including [RFC1918] addresses, such that
   IPv4-IPv4 address pairs are favoured over ULA-ULA address pairs.  For
   many site operators this behavior will be counter-intuitive, given
   the IPv6 GUA preference, and may create difficulties with respect to
   planning, operational, and security implications for environments
   where ULA addressing is used in IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack network
   scenarios.  The expected default prioritization of IPv6 traffic over
   IPv4 by default, as happens with IPv6 GUA addressing, does not happen
   for ULAs.

   As a result, the use of ULAs is not a viable option for dual-stack
   networking transition planning, large scale network modeling, network
   lab environments or other modes of large scale networking that run
   both IPv4 and IPv6 concurrently with the expectation that IPv6 will
   be preferred by default.

   The other issue is that where nodes in a dual-stack site are
   addressed from both ULA and GUA prefixes, RFC 6724 will see GUA-GUA
   address pairs chosen over ULA-ULA.  One goal of ULA addressing was to
   allow local communications to be independent of the availablility of
   external connectivity and addressing, such that persistent ULAs can
   be used even when the global prefix made available to a site is
   withdrawn or changes.

   This document therefore introduces two changes to RFC 6724 such that
   a node implements elevated or differential preference for ULAs in
   specific conditions, one for preference over IPv4, one for preference
   over IPv6 GUAs.

   The first change is an update to the default policy table to elevate
   the preference for ULAs such that ULAs, like GUAs, will be preferred
   over all IPv4 addresses, providing more consistent and less confusing
   behavior for operators, and to assist operators in phasing out IPv4
   from dual-stack environments.  This is an important enabler for sites
   seeking to move from dual-stack to IPv6-only networking.

   The second change is the introduction of the concept of known-local
   ULAs.  RFC 6724 includes a method by which nodes MAY provide more
   fine-grained support for further elevating the preference for
   specific ULA prefixes, while leaving other general ULA prefixes at
   the precedence described in the previous paragraph.  This document
   elevates the requirement for specific ULA prefixes to be inserted
   into the policy table to be a MUST, but only for observed prefixes
   that are known to be local, i.e., known-local ULAs.  Nodes

Internet-Draft  Prioritizing known-local ULAs in RFC 672   November 2024


   implementing this behaviour will see ULA prefixes known to be local
   to the node's site having precedence over IPv6 GUA addresses, such
   that they can use ULA addressing independently of global prefixes
   within their site and continue to use GUA-GUA address pairs to talk
   to destinations external to their site.

   These changes aim to improve the default handling of address
   selection for common cases, and unmanaged / automatic scenarios
   rather than those where DHCPv6 is deployed.  The changes are
   discussed in more detail in the following sections, with a further
   section providing a summary of the proposed updates.

4.  Preference of 6to4 addresses

   The anycast prefix for 6to4 relays was formally deprecated by
   [RFC7526] in 2015, and since that time the use of 6to4 addressing has
   further declined, with very little evidence of its use on the public
   internet.  Note that RFC 7526 does not deprecate the 6to4 IPv6 prefix
   2002::/16, it only deprecates the 6to4 Relay IPv4 prefix.

   This document therefore demotes the precedence of the 6to4 prefix in
   the policy table to the same precedence as carried by the Teredo
   prefix.  Leaving this entry in the default table will cause no
   problems and will help if any deployments still exist, and ensure
   6to4 prefixes are differentiated from general GUAs.

   The discussion regarding the adding of 6to4 site prefixes in section
   10.7 of RFC6724 remains valid.

5.  Adjustments to RFC 6724

   This document makes three specific changes to RFC 6724: first to
   update the default policy table, second to change Rule 5.5 on
   prefering addresses in a prefix advertised by the next-hop to a MUST,
   and third to require that nodes MUST insert observed known-local ULAs
   into their policy table.

5.1.  Policy Table Update

   This update alters the default policy table listed in Rule 2.1 of RFC
   6724.

   The table below reflects the current RFC 6724 state on the left, and
   the updated state defined by this RFC on the right:

(*) value(s) changed in update

   The update moves 2002::/16 to de-preference its status in line with
   [RFC7526] and moves the precedence of fc00::/7 above legacy IPv4,
   with ::ffff:0:0/96 now set to precedence 20.

5.2.  Rule 5.5

   The heuristic for address selection defined in Rule 5.5 of Section 5
   of RFC 6724 to prefer addresses in a prefix advertised by a next-hop
   router has proven to be very useful.

   The text in RFC 6724 states that the Rules MUST be followed in order,
   but also includes a discussion note under Rule 5.5 that says that an
   IPv6 implementation is not required to remember which next-hops
   advertised which prefixes and thus that Rule 5.5 is only applicable
   to implementations that track this information.

   This document removes that exception and elevates the requirement to
   prefer addresses in a prefix advertised by a next-hop router to a
   MUST for all nodes.

   This change means that an IPv6 implementation will need to remember
   which next-hops advertised which prefixes [RFC8028], although the
   conceptual models of IPv6 hosts in Section 5 of [RFC4861] and
   Section 3 of [RFC4191] have no such requirement.

5.3.  Automatic insertion of known-local ULA prefixes into the policy
      table

   Section 2.1 of RFC 6724 states that "an implementation MAY
   automatically add additional site-specific rows to the default table
   based on its configured addresses, such as for Unique Local Addresses
   (ULAs)", but it provides no detail on how such behavior might be
   implemented.

Internet-Draft  Prioritizing known-local ULAs in RFC 672   November 2024


   If a node can determine which ULA prefix(es) are known to be local,
   it can provide differential treatment for those over general ULAs,
   and insert these into the policy table at a higher precedence than
   GUAs while keeping all general ULA prefixes to a lower precedence.

   This document thus elevates the MAY requirement above for insertion
   to a MUST for the specific case of known-local ULAs.

   These known-local ULA prefixes are inferred from ULA addresses
   assigned to interfaces or learned from Prefix Information Options
   (PIOs) in Router Advertisements (RAs) [RFC4861] received on any
   interface regardless of how the PIO flags are set.  Further, they are
   learned from Route Information Options (RIOs) in RAs received on any
   interface by Type C hosts that process RIOs, as defined in [RFC4191].

   Section 3.1 of RFC 4193 only defines ULA prefixes where the L-bit is
   set to 1, i.e., prefixes under fd00::/8 where the prefix is locally
   assigned or generated.  The use of ULAs where L=0, i.e., prefixes
   under fc00::/8, is currently undefined.

   The following rules define how the learnt known-local ULA prefixes
   under fd00::/8 are inserted into the address selection policy table
   for a node, through a conceptual list of known-local prefixes.

   1.  RIOs from within fd00::/8 are considered the preferred
       information source for determining known-local ULAs and should
       override other conflicting information or assumptions from other
       sources, including PIOs.

   2.  RIOs within fd00::/8 that are of length /40 or longer MUST be
       added to the known-local ULA list.  RIOs for shorter prefixes
       MUST NOT be used to insert known-local ULA entries in the address
       selection policy table

   3.  PIOs within fd00::/8 of length /64 that are not already in the
       nodes known-local ULA list MUST be added to the list with an
       assumed prefix length of /48, regardless of how the PIO flags are
       set.

   4.  ULA interface addresses from within fd00::/8, particularly ones
       not created by SLAAC, and not already covered by the known-local
       ULA list MUST be added to the list with an assumed prefix length
       of /48.

   5.  Regardless of their length or how the PIO flags are set, other
       PIOs from within fd00::/8 that are not already covered by the
       known-local ULA list MAY be added to the list, but only with the
       advertised prefix length.

Internet-Draft  Prioritizing known-local ULAs in RFC 672   November 2024


   6.  When inserting known-local ULA entries into the policy table,
       they MUST have a label of 14 (rather than the default ULA label
       of 13) and a precedence of 45.

   7.  Entries MUST be removed from the known-local ULA list and the
       Policy Table when the announced RIOs or PIOs are deprecated, or
       an interface address is removed, and there is no covering RIO or
       PIO.

   When support is added for the insertion of known-local ULA prefixes
   it MUST default to on, but a mechanism SHOULD be supported to
   administratively toggle the behaviour off and on.

   Tools that display a node's default policy table MUST show all
   currently inserted known-local ULA prefixes.

   The identification and insertion of known-local prefixes under
   fc00::/8 is currently not defined.

   Note that a practical limit exists on the number of RIOs and PIOs
   that can be placed into a single RA.  Therefore, there is a practical
   limit to the number of known-local ULAs that can be expressed on a
   single network and the number of ULA prefixes that can automatically
   be preferred over GUA prefixes within the policy table.  This limit
   is unlikely to impact most networks, especially residential and other
   small unmanaged networks that automatically generate ULA prefixes.

   Section 4 of RFC 4191 says, "Routers SHOULD NOT send more than 17
   Route Information Options in Router Advertisements per link.  This
   arbitrary bound is meant to reinforce that relatively few and
   carefully selected routes should be advertised to hosts.  The exact
   limit will depend on other Options that are used.  So while this is
   not the practical limit discussed above, operators MUST take extra
   care not to overflow the RA with RA Options when exceeding this
   limit.

   Note that in the case of Rule 2 above it would be expected that ULA
   prefixes being included in the known-local prefix list be compliant
   with Section 3 of RFC4193 (i.e., /48 in size) but the above rule is
   pragmatic in that it allows the use of ULA prefixes of up to /40 in
   length.  Most networks use ("are expected to use") /48 prefixes as
   per RFC4193.  However, it is possible that in some circumstances a
   larger managed enterprise may wish to use a shorter prefix (e.g., to
   simplify management, filtering rules, etc, and to overcome the issue
   with the number of RIOs an RA can carry as described in the above
   paragraph).  However, such non-compliant use of ULAs may be
   problematic in other ways, e.g., carrying an increased risk of
   collision with other ULA prefixes, where you might be using someone
   else's compliant prefix because shorter prefixes have a lower chance
   to be globally unique.

6.  Configuration of the default policy table

   As stated in Section 2.1 of RFC 6724 "IPv6 implementations SHOULD
   support configurable address selection via a mechanism at least as
   powerful as the policy tables defined here".

   Based on operational experience to date, it is important that node
   policy tables can be changed once deployed to support future emerging
   use cases.  This update thus re-states the importance of such
   configurability.

7.  Intended behaviors

   In this section we review the intended default behaviors after this
   update is applied.

7.1.  GUA-GUA preferred over IPv4-IPv4

   This is the current behaviour, and remains unaltered.  The rationale
   is to promote use of IPv6 GUAs in dual-stack environments.

7.2.  GUA-GUA preferred over ULA-ULA

   This is the current behaviour, and remains unaltered for the general
   case.

   However, where a ULA prefix is determined to be local, and added as a
   known-local ULA prefix to a node's address selection policy table,
   communications to addresses in other known-local ULA prefixes will
   prefer ULA-ULA address pairs to GUA-GUA (matching label, higher
   precedence).

Internet-Draft  Prioritizing known-local ULAs in RFC 672   November 2024


7.3.  Known-local ULA - Known-local ULA preferred over GUA-GUA

   As described in the previous case, this document elevates preference
   for use of ULAs over GUAs in cases where the ULA prefix(es) in use
   can be determined to be local to a site or organization.

   By only adapting this behaviour for known-local ULAs, a node will not
   select a ULA source to talk to a non-local ULA destination and will
   instead correctly use GUA-GUA.

   Nodes not yet implementing this RFC will continue to use GUA-GUA over
   ULA-ULA for all cases.

   As an example, consider a site that uses prefixes ULA1::/48,
   ULA2::/48 and GUA1::/48.

   Host A has address ULA1::1 and GUA1:1::1 Host B has address ULA2::1
   and GUA1:2::1

   Both ULA prefixes have been determined to be known-local through
   RIOs.  Perhaps ULA2 is reachable within the site, but its prefix is
   not in direct use at host A.

   If host A sends to host B the candidate pairs are ULA1::1 – ULA2::1
   and GUA1::1::1 – GUA1:2::1.

   In this case ULA1::1 – ULA2::1 wins because of matching labels (both
   14) and higher precedence than GUA (45 vs 40).

   If host A were to send to a host C with addresses ULA3::1 (where
   ULA3::/48 has not been learned to be a known-local prefix) and
   GUA2:1::1, host A would use the GUA address pair for the
   communication as the GUAs have matching labels (both 1) where the
   known-local ULA and general ULA do not (14 and 13 respectively).

7.4.  ULA-ULA preferred over IPv4-IPv4

   This update changes previous behavior for this case.  RFC 6724 as
   originally defined would lead to IPv4 being preferred over ULAs,
   which is contrary to the spirit of the IPv6 GUA preference over IPv4,
   and to the goal of removing evidenced use of IPv4 in a dual-stack
   site before transitioning to IPv6-only.

   This document elevates the precedence of general ULAs above IPv4, so
   ULA-ULA address pairs will be chosen over IPv4-IPv4 pairs (matching
   label, higher precedence).

Internet-Draft  Prioritizing known-local ULAs in RFC 672   November 2024


7.5.  IPv4-IPv4 preferred over ULA-GUA

   An IPv6 ULA address will only be preferred over an IPv4 address if
   both IPv6 ULA source and destination addresses are available.  With
   Rule 5 of Section 6 of RFC 6724 and the ULA-specific label added in
   [RFC6724] (which was not present in [RFC3484]) an IPv4 source and
   destination will be preferred over an IPv6 ULA source and an IPv6 GUA
   destination address, even though generally IPv6 ULA addresses are
   preferred over IPv4 in the policy table as proposed in this update.
   The IPv4 matching label trumps ULA-GUA.

8.  Discussion of ULA source with GUA or remote ULA destination

   In this section we present a discussion on the scenarios where a ULA
   source may be communicating with a GUA or ULA destination.

   A potential problem exists when a ULA source attempts to communicate
   with GUA or remote ULA destinations.  In these scenarios, the ULA
   source as stated earlier is by default intended for communication
   only with the local network, meaning an individual site, several
   sites that are part of the same organization, or multiple sites
   across cooperating organizations, as detailed in [RFC4193].  As a
   result, most GUA and ULA destinations are not attached to the same
   local network as the ULA source and are, therefore, not reachable
   from the ULA source.

   Scenario 1: ULA source and GUA destination

   When only a ULA source is available for communication with GUA
   destinations, this generally implies no connectivity to the IPv6
   Internet is available.  Otherwise, a GUA source would have been made
   available and selected for use with GUA destinations.  As a result,
   the ULA source will typically fail when it attempts to communicate
   with most GUA destinations.  However, corner cases exist where the
   ULA source will not fail, such as when GUA destinations are attached
   to the same local network as the ULA source.

   Scenario 2: ULA source and remote ULA destination













Buraglio, et al.           Expires 8 May 2025                  [Page 12]

Internet-Draft  Prioritizing known-local ULAs in RFC 672   November 2024


   Receiving a DNS response for a ULA destination that is not attached
   to the local network, in other words, a remote ULA destination, is
   considered a misconfiguration in most cases, or at least this
   contradicts the operational guidelines provided in Section 4.4 of RFC
   4193.  Nevertheless, this can occur, and the ULA source will
   typically fail when it attempts to communicate with ULA destinations
   that are not attached to the same local network as the ULA source.
   This case provides a rationale for implementing support for known-
   local ULA prefix insertion in the policy table, such that
   differential behaviour can be applied for known-local versus general
   ULA prefixes.

   The remainder of this section discusses several complementary
   mechanisms involved with these scenarios.

8.1.  The ULA Label and its Precedence

   RFC 6724 added (in obsoleting RFC 3484) a separate label for ULAs
   (the whole range, under fc00::/7), whose default precedence is raised
   by this update.  This separate label interacts with Rule 5 of
   Section 6 of RFC 6724, which says:

   Rule 5: Prefer matching label.

   If Label(Source(DA)) = Label(DA) and Label(Source(DB)) <> Label(DB),
   then prefer DA.

   Similarly, if Label(Source(DA)) <> Label(DA) and Label(Source(DB)) =
   Label(DB), then prefer DB.

   In the first scenario, the ULA source label will not match the GUA
   destination label.  Therefore, an IPv4 destination, if available,
   will be preferred over a GUA destination with a ULA source, even
   though the GUA destination has higher precedence than the IPv4
   destination in the policy table.  This means the IPv4 destination
   will be moved up in the list of destinations over the GUA destination
   with the ULA source.

   If the ULA (fc00::/7) label is removed from the policy table, a GUA
   destination with a ULA source will be preferred over an IPv4
   destination, as GUA and ULA will be part of the same label (for
   ::/0).

   In the second scenario, the ULA source label will match the ULA
   destination label.  Therefore, whether part of the local network or
   not, a ULA destination will be preferred over an IPv4 destination.

Internet-Draft  Prioritizing known-local ULAs in RFC 672   November 2024


   Where known-local ULA prefix insertion is implemented for prefixes
   under fd00::/8, the known-local ULA will have a higher precedence
   (45) than either IPv6 GUAs (40) or IPv4 (20), while general ULAs will
   have the lowest precedence (10).

   If the general ULA label (for all fc00::/7) has its precedence
   lowered below IPv4 or the IPv4 precedence is raised above ULA, an
   IPv4 destination will be preferred over all ULA destinations.

8.2.  Happy Eyeballs

   Regardless of the preference resulting from the above discussion,
   Happy Eyeballs version 1 [RFC6555] or version 2 [RFC8305], if
   implemented, will try both the GUA or ULA destination with the ULA
   source and the IPv4 destination and source pairings.  The ULA source
   will typically fail to communicate with most GUA or remote ULA
   destinations, and IPv4 will be preferred if IPv4 connectivity is
   available unless the GUA or ULA destinations are attached to the same
   local network as the ULA source.

8.3.  Try the Next Address

   As stated in Section 2 of RFC 6724:

   "Well-behaved applications SHOULD NOT simply use the first address
   returned from an API such as getaddrinfo() and then give up if it
   fails.  For many applications, it is appropriate to iterate through
   the list of addresses returned from getaddrinfo() until a working
   address is found.  For other applications, it might be appropriate to
   try multiple addresses in parallel (e.g., with some small delay in
   between) and use the first one to succeed."

   Therefore, when an IPv4 destination is preferred over GUA or ULA
   destinations, IPv4 will likely succeed if IPv4 connectivity is
   available, and the GUA or ULA destination may only be tried if Happy
   Eyeballs is implemented.

   On the other hand, if the GUA or ULA destination with the ULA source
   is preferred, the ULA source will typically fail to communicate with
   GUA or ULA destinations that are not connected to the same local
   network.  However, if the operational guidelines in Section 4.3 of
   RFC 4193 are followed, recognizing this failure can be accelerated,
   and transport layer timeouts (e.g., TCP) can be avoided.  The
   guidelines will cause a Destination Unreachable ICMPv6 Error to be
   received by the source device, signaling the next address in the list
   to be tried, as discussed above.

9.  Following ULA operational guidelines in RFC 4193

   This section re-emphasises two important operational requirements
   stated in [RFC4193] that should be followed by operators.

9.1.  Filtering ULA-source addresses at site borders

   Section 4.3 states "Site border routers and firewalls should be
   configured to not forward any packets with Local IPv6 source or
   destination addresses outside of the site, unless they have been
   explicitly configured with routing information about specific /48 or
   longer Local IPv6 prefixes".

   And further that "Site border routers should respond with the
   appropriate ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable message to inform the
   source that the packet was not forwarded".

   As stated in the above discussion, such ICMPv6 messages can assist in
   fast failover for TCP connections.

9.2.  Avoid using ULA addresses in the global DNS

   Section 4.3 of RFC 4193 states that "AAAA and PTR records for locally
   assigned local IPv6 addresses are not recommended to be installed in
   the global DNS."

   This is particularly important given the general method presented in
   this document elevates the priority for ULAs above IPv4.  However,
   where support for insertion of known-local prefixes is implemented,
   such "rogue" ULAs in the global DNS are no longer a concern for
   address selection as they would have the lowest precedence.

10.  The practicalities of implementing address selection support

   As with most adjustments to standards, and using the introduction of
   RFC 6724 as a measuring stick, the updates defined in this document
   will likely take several years to become common enough for consistent
   behavior within most operating systems.  At the time of writing, it
   has been over 10 years since RFC 6724 has been published but we
   continue to see existing commercial and open source operating systems
   exhibiting RFC 3484 (or other) behavior.

   While it should be noted that RFC 6724 defines a solution to adjust
   the address preference selection table that is functional
   theoretically, operationally the solution is operating system
   dependent and in practice policy table changes cannot be signaled by
   any currently deployed network mechanism.  While RFC 7078 defines
   such a DHCPv6 option, there are few if any implementations.  This

Internet-Draft  Prioritizing known-local ULAs in RFC 672   November 2024


   lack of an intra-protocol or network-based ability to adjust address
   selection preference, along with the inability to adjust a notable
   number of operating systems either programmatically or manually,
   renders operational scalability of such a mechanism challenging.

   It is especially important to note this behavior in the long
   lifecycle equipment that exists in industrial control and operational
   technology environments due to their very long mean time to
   replacement/lifecycle.

11.  Limitations of RFC 6724

   The procedures defined in RFC 6724 do not give optimal results for
   all scenarios.  As stated in the introduction, the aim of this update
   is to improve the behavior for the most common scenarios.

   It is widely recognised in the IETF 6man WG that the whole 3484/6724/
   getaddrinfo() model is fundamentally inadequate for optimal address
   selection.  A model that considers address pairs directly, rather
   than sorting on destination addresses with the best source for that
   address, would be preferable, but beyond the scope of this document.

   To simplify address selection, operators may instead look to deploy
   IPv6-only and/or may choose to only use GUA addresses and no ULA
   addresses.  Other approaches to reduce the use of IPv4, e.g., through
   use of DHCPv4 Option 108 as defined in [RFC8925] as part of an "IPv6
   Mostly" deployment model, also helps simplify address selection for
   nodes.

13.  Security Considerations

   There are no direct security considerations in this document.

Internet-Draft  Prioritizing known-local ULAs in RFC 672   November 2024


   The mixed preference for IPv6 over IPv4 from the default policy table
   in RFC 6724 represents a potential security issue, given an operator
   may expect ULAs to be used when in practice RFC 1918 addresses are
   used instead.

   The requirements of RFC 4193, stated earlier in this document, should
   be followed for optimal behavior.

   Operators should be mindful of cases where communicating nodes have
   differing behaviours for address selection, e.g., RFC3484 behavior,
   RFC6724, the updated RFC6724 behavior defined here, some other non-
   IETF-standardized behavior, or even no mechanism.  There may thus be
   inconsistent behaviour for communications initiated in each direction
   between two nodes.  Ultimately all nodes should be made compliant to
   the updated specification described in this document.

14.  IANA Considerations

   None.

   *  Changed default policy table to move fc00::/7 to precedence 30,
      above legacy IPv4.

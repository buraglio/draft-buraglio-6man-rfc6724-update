           Updating RFC 6724 based on Operational Experience
                   draft-ietf-6man-rfc6724-update-05

Abstract

   When [RFC6724] was published it defined an address selection
   algorithm along with a default policy table, and noted a number of
   examples where that policy table might benefit from adjustment for
   specific scenarios.  It also noted that it is important for
   implementations to provide a way to change the default policies as
   more experience is gained.  This update draws on several years of
   operational experience to refine RFC 6724 further, with particular
   emphasis on preference for the use of ULA addresses over IPv4
   addresses, mandatory support for Rule 5.5, and requirements both that
   sites apply the ULA filtering principles described in RFC 4193 and
   that ULAs are not published in the global DNS.  This update also
   demotes the preference for 6to4 addresses.  The changes to default
   behavior improve supportability of common use cases, including
   automatic / unmanaged scenarios.  It is recognized that some less
   common deployment scenarios may require explicit configuration or
   custom changes to achieve desired operational parameters.

1.  Introduction

   Since its publication in 2012, [RFC6724] has become an important
   mechanism by which nodes can perform address selection, deriving the
   most appropriate source and destination address pair to use from a
   candidate set by following the procedures defined in the RFC.  Part
   of the process involves the use of a policy table, where the
   precedence and labels for address prefixes are listed, and for which
   a default table is defined.

   It was always expected that the default policy table may need to be
   updated from operational experience; section 2.1 says "It is
   important that implementations provide a way to change the default
   policies as more experience is gained" and points to the examples in
   Section 10, which include Section 10.6 where a ULA example is
   presented.

   This document is written on the basis of such operational experience,
   in particular for scenarios where ULAs are used for their intended
   purpose within a site, but also includes updated requirements on
   support for RFC 6724 Rule 5.5, and for filtering packets with ULA
   source addresses at site borders.

   An IPv6 deployment, whether enterprise, residential or other, may use
   combinations of IPv6 GUAs, IPv6 ULAs, IPv4 globals, IPv4 RFC 1918
   addressing, and may or may not use some form of NAT.  However, this
   document makes no comment or recommendation on how ULAs are used, or
   on the use of NAT in an IPv6 network.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Operational Issues Regarding Preference for IPv4 addresses over ULAs

   Where getaddrinfo() or a comparable API is used, the sorting behavior
   should take into account both the source address of the requesting
   node as well as the destination addresses returned, and sort these
   following the procedures defined in RFC 6724.

Internet-Draft               RFC 6724 update               December 2023


   The current default policy table leads to preference for IPv6 GUAs
   over IPv4 globals, which is widely considered preferential behavior
   to support greater use of IPv6 in dual-stack environments.  This
   allows sites to phase out IPv4 as its evidenced use becomes ever
   lower.

   However, the default policy table also puts IPv6 ULAs below all IPv4
   addresses, including [RFC1918] addresses.  For many site operators
   this behavior will be counter-intuitive, and may create difficulties
   with respect to planning, operational, and security implications for
   environments where ULA addressing is used in IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack
   network scenarios.  The expected prioritization of IPv6 traffic over
   IPv4 by default, as happens with IPv6 GUA addressing, does not by
   default happen for ULAs.

   As a result, the use of ULAs is not a viable option for dual-stack
   networking transition planning, large scale network modeling, network
   lab environments or other modes of large scale networking that run
   both IPv4 and IPv6 concurrently with the expectation that IPv6 will
   be preferred by default.

   This document updates the default policy table to elevate the
   preference for ULAs such that ULAs will be preferred over all IPv4
   addresses, providing more consistent and less confusing behavior for
   operators, and to assist operators in phasing out IPv4 from dual-
   stack environments, since by this update IPv6 GUAs and ULAs will be
   preferred over any IPv4 addresses.  This is an important enabler for
   sites seeking to move from dual-stack to IPv6-only networking.

   This change aims to improve the default handling of address selection
   for common cases, and unmanaged / automatic scenarios rather than
   those where DHCPv6 is deployed.  Sites using DHCPv6 for host
   configuration management can make use of implementations of [RFC7078]
   to apply changes to the [RFC6724] policy table.

   The changes are discussed in more detail in the following sections,
   with a further section providing a summary of the proposed updates.

4.  Preference of 6to4 addresses

   The anycast prefix for 6to4 relays was deprecated by [RFC7526] in
   2015, and since that time the use of 6to4 addressing has further
   declined to the point where it is generally not seen and can be
   considered to all intents and purposes deprecated in use.

   This document therefore demotes the precedence of the 6to4 prefix in
   the policy table to the same minimum preference as carried by the
   deprecated site local and 6bone address prefixes.

5.  Adjustments to RFC 6724

   This update makes three specific changes to RFC 6724: first, to
   update the default policy table, second, change the next hop
   advertised prefix by the next hop (Rule 5.5) to a MUST, and third the
   (recommended) option to automatically insert "known-local" ULA
   prefixes into the policy table.

5.1.  Policy Table Update

   This update alters the default policy table listed in Rule 2.1 of RFC
   6724.

   The table below reflects the current RFC 6724 state on the left, and
   the updated state defined by this RFC on the right:

                    RFC 6724                                            Updated
      Prefix        Precedence Label                      Prefix        Precedence Label
      ::1/128               50     0                      ::1/128               50     0
      ::/0                  40     1                      ::/0                  40     1
      ::ffff:0:0/96         35     4                      ::ffff:0:0/96         20     4 (*)
      2002::/16             30     2                      2002::/16              5     2 (*)
      2001::/32              5     5                      2001::/32              5     5
      fc00::/7               3    13                      fc00::/7              30    13 (*)
      ::/96                  1     3                      ::/96                  1     3
      fec0::/10              1    11                      fec0::/10              1     11
      3ffe::/16              1    12                      3ffe::/16              1     12

 (*) value(s) changed in update

   This preference table update moves 2002::/16 to de-preference its
   status in line with RFC 7526 and changes the precedence of fc00::/7
   above legacy IPv4, with ::ffff:0:0/96 now set to precedence 20.

5.2.  Rule 5.5

   The heuristic for address selection defined in Section 5.5 of RFC
   6724 to prefer addresses in a prefix advertised by a next-hop router
   has proven to be very useful.  RFC 6724 does not state any
   requirement for SHOULD or MUST for this heuristic to be used; this
   update therefore amends section 5.5 to reflect that a system MUST
   apply the next-hop tracking heuristic, comminly referred to as Rule
   5.5.

5.3.  Automatic insertion of Known-Local ULAs

   ** Do we include this at all, or beef up the RFC 4193 section 4.4
   text that says "AAAA and PTR records for locally assigned local IPv6
   addresses are not recommended to be installed in the global DNS", and
   that this _IS_ a misconfiguration, and point to Dan Wing's data that
   suggests most people don't do it?

   This update also introduces the concept of "known-local" ULAs.  The
   new default behaviour introduced by this update elevates all ULAs
   above all IPv4 addresses.  However, it is possible that a node in a
   destination network may have a host name with a ULA address in its
   global DNS entry.  In such cases connectivity to that node is
   unlikely to work (in the absence of specific configured routing).

   ** Do we want to add support for misconfigurations?  Data suggests
   that less than 0.1% of published AAAAs are ULAs

   To avoid such potential issues, this update additionally states that
   an implementation SHOULD automatically add rows in the default policy
   table for all ULA site prefixes that can be derived from received
   Router Advertisements (RAs) [RFC4861] given their Prefix Information
   Options (PIOs) or Route Information Options (RIOs) [RFC4191].  Such
   derived /48 prefixes are referred to as "known-local" ULAs and SHOULD
   have a precedence of 45.

   Note that RFC 6724 states in Section 2.1 that "An implementation MAY
   automatically add additional site-specific rows to the default table
   based on its configured addresses, such as for Unique Local Addresses
   (ULAs)" and in Section 10.3 that "Since ULAs are defined to have a
   /48 site prefix, an implementation might choose to add such a row
   automatically on a machine with a ULA."  Here we are elevating that
   MAY/might to a SHOULD.

   Nodes implementing the automated increased precedence for known-local
   ULAs /48s SHOULD also set the default precedence for the ULA label
   (fc00::/7) to 10.

   ** Note ** the downside to this is that if a node cannot determine
   that another ULA in the same organisational network is "known-local"
   it will prefer IPv4 if dual-stack

6.  Configuration of the default policy table

   As stated in Section 2.1 of RFC 6724 "IPv6 implementations SHOULD
   support configurable address selection via a mechanism at least as
   powerful as the policy tables defined here".  While this document
   defines changes to RFC 6724 behavior based on operational experience
   to date, it is important that node policy tables can be changed once
   deployed to support future emerging use cases.

7.  Intended behaviors

   In this section we reiew the intended default behaviors after this
   update is applied.

7.1.  GUA-GUA preferred over IPv4-IPv4

   This is the current behaviour, and remains unaltered.  The rationale
   is to promote use of IPv6 GUAs in dual-stack environments.

7.2.  ULA-ULA preferred over GUA-GUA

   This is the current behaviour, and remains unaltered.  The rationale
   is to support consistent, stable addressing in a site where the
   global prefix might change over time, or become unavailable.

7.3.  ULA-ULA preferred over IPv4-IPv4

   This is a change introduced by this update.  RFC 6724 as orginally
   defined would lead to IPv4 being preferred over ULAs, which is
   contrary to the spirit of the GUA preference over IPv4, and to the
   goal of removing use of IPv4 in a dual-stack site before
   transitioning to IPv6-only.

7.4.  IPv4-IPv4 preferred over ULA-GUA

   An IPv6 ULA address will only be preferred over an IPv4 address if
   both IPv6 ULA source and destination addresses are available.  With
   Rule 5 of Section 6 of RFC 6724 and the ULA-specific label added in
   RFC 6724 (which was not present in RFC 3484) an IPv4 source and
   destination will be preferred over an IPv6 ULA source and an IPv6 GUA
   destination address, even though generally IPv6 ULA addresses are
   preferred over IPv4 in the policy table as proposed in this update.
   The IPv4 matching label trumps ULA-GUA.

8.  Discussion of ULA source with GUA or remote ULA destinations

   A potential problem exists when a ULA source attempts to communicate
   with GUA or remote ULA destinations.  In these scenarios, the ULA
   source is generally intended for communication only with the local
   network, meaning an individual site, several sites that are part of
   the same organization, or multiple sites across cooperating
   organizations, as detailed in RFC 4193.  As a result, most GUA and
   ULA destinations are not attached to the same local network as the
   ULA source and are, therefore, not reachable from the ULA source.

   When only a ULA source is available for communication with GUA
   destinations, this generally implies no connectivity to the IPv6
   Internet is available.  Otherwise, a GUA source would have been made
   available and selected for use with GUA destinations.  As a result,
   the ULA source will typically fail when it attempts to communicate
   with most GUA destinations.  However, corner cases exist where the
   ULA source will not fail, such as when GUA destinations are attached
   to the same local network as the ULA source.

   Receiving a DNS response for a ULA destination that is not attached
   to the local network, in other words, a remote ULA destination, is
   considered a misconfiguration in most cases, or at least this
   contradicts the operational guidelines provided in Section 4.4 of RFC
   4193.  Nevertheless, this can occur, and the ULA source will
   typically fail when it attempts to communicate with ULA destinations
   that are not attached to the same local network as the ULA source.

   This section discusses several complementary mechanisms involved with
   these scenarios.

8.1.  The ULA Label and its Precedence

   RFC 6724 added (in obsoleting RFC 3484) a separate label for ULA
   (fc00::/7), whose default precedence is raised by this update.  This
   separate label interacts with Rule 5 of Section 6 of RFC 6724, which
   says;

  Rule 5: Prefer matching label.
  If Label(Source(DA)) = Label(DA) and Label(Source(DB)) <> Label(DB), then prefer DA.  Similarly, if       Label(Source(DA)) <> Label(DA) and Label(Source(DB)) = Label(DB), then prefer DB.

   The ULA source label will not match the GUA destination label in the
   first scenario.  Therefore, an IPv4 destination, if available, will
   be preferred over a GUA destination with a ULA source, even though
   the GUA destination has higher precedence than the IPv4 destination
   in the policy table.  This means the IPv4 destination will be moved
   up in the list of destinations over the GUA destination with the ULA
   source.

Internet-Draft               RFC 6724 update               December 2023


   If the ULA (fc00::/7) label is removed from the policy table, a GUA
   destination with a ULA source will be preferred over an IPv4
   destination, as GUA and ULA will be part of the same label (::/0).

   The ULA source label will match the ULA destination label in the
   second scenario; therefore, whether part of the local network or not,
   a ULA destination will be preferred over an IPv4 destination.

   If the ULA label (fc00::/7) has its precedence lowered below IPv4 or
   the IPv4 precedence is raised above ULA, as with the RFC 6724
   unupdate policy table.  In this case, an IPv4 destination will be
   preferred over all ULA destinations.

8.2.  Happy Eyeballs

   Regardless of the preference resulting from the above discussion,
   Happy Eyeballs version 1 (RFC 6555) or version 2 (RFC 8305), if
   implemented, will try both the GUA or ULA destination with the ULA
   source and the IPv4 destination and source pairings.  The ULA source
   will typically fail to communicate with most GUA or remote ULA
   destinations, and IPv4 will be preferred if IPv4 connectivity is
   available unless the GUA or ULA destinations are attached to the same
   local network as the ULA source.

8.3.  Try the Next Address

   As stated in Section 2 of RFC 6724,

  Well-behaved applications SHOULD NOT simply use the first address returned from an API such as
  getaddrinfo() and then give up if it fails. For many applications, it is appropriate to iterate
  through the list of addresses returned from getaddrinfo() until a working address is found. For
  other applications, it might be appropriate to try multiple addresses in parallel (e.g., with some
  small delay in between) and use the first one to succeed.

   Therefore, when an IPv4 destination is preferred over GUA or ULA
   destinations, IPv4 will likely succeed if IPv4 connectivity is
   available, and the GUA or ULA destination may only be tried if Happy
   Eyeballs is implemented.

   On the other hand, if the GUA or ULA destination with the ULA source
   is preferred, the ULA source will typically fail to communicate GUA
   or ULA destinations that are not connected to the same local network
   as the ULA source.  However, suppose the operational guidelines in
   Section 4.3 of RFC 4193 are followed, as discussed in the Security
   Considerations below.  In this case, recognizing this failure can be
   accelerated, and transport layer timeouts (e.g., TCP) can be avoided.
   These guidelines will cause a Destination Unreachable ICMPv6 Error to
   be received by the source device, signaling the next address in the
   list to be tried, as discussed above.

9.  Filtering ULA-source addresses at site borders

   RFC 4193 Section 4.3 states "Site border routers and firewalls should
   be configured to not forward any packets with Local IPv6 source or
   destination addresses outside of the site, unless they have been
   explicitly configured with routing information about specific /48 or
   longer Local IPv6 prefixes".

   This document requires that such site border routers and firewalls
   MUST be configured to not forward by default any packets with Local
   IPv6 source or destination addresses outside of the site, unless
   specifically configured to do so.

10.  ULA addresses in the gloabl DNS

   Section 4.3 of RFC 4193 states that "At the present time, AAAA and
   PTR records for locally assigned local IPv6 addresses are not
   recommended to be installed in the global DNS."

   This document requires that AAAA and PTR records for ULAs MUST NOT be
   installed in the global DNS.

11.  The practicalities of implementing address selection support

   As with most adjustments to standards, and using the introduction of
   RFC 6724 as a measuring stick, the updates defined in this document
   will likely take several years to become common enough for consistent
   behavior within most operating systems.  At the time of writing, it
   has been over 10 years since RFC 6724 has been published but we
   continue to see existing commercial and open source operating systems
   exhibiting RFC 3484 behavior.

   While it should be noted that RFC 6724 defines a solution to adjust
   the address preference selection table that is functional
   theoretically, operationally the solution is operating system
   dependent and in practice policy table changes cannot be signaled by
   any currently deployed network mechanism.  While RFC 7078 defines

Internet-Draft               RFC 6724 update               December 2023


   such a DHCPv6 option, it is not widely implemented.  This lack of an
   intra-protocol or network-based ability to adjust address selection
   preference, along with the inability to adjust a notable number of
   operating systems either programmatically or manually, renders
   operational scalability of such a mechanism challenging.

   It is especially important to note this behavior in the long
   lifecycle equipment that exists in industrial control and operational
   technology environments due to their very long mean time to
   replacement/lifecycle.

12.  Limitations of RFC 6724

   The procedures defined in RFC 6724 do not give optimal results for
   all scenarios.  The aim of this update is to improve the behavior for
   the most common scenarios.

   It is widely recognised in the IETF 6man WG that the whole 3484/6724/
   getaddrinfo() model is fundamentally inadequate for optimal address
   selection.  A model that considered adress pairs directly, rather
   than sorting on destination addresses with the best source for that
   address, would be preferable, but beyond the scope of this document.

   To simplify address selection, operators may instead look to deploy
   IPv6-only, and may choose to only use GUA addresses and no ULA
   addresses.

   To be removed on publication.

Internet-Draft               RFC 6724 update               December 2023


   The mixed preference for IPv6 over IPv4 from the default policy table
   in RFC 6724 represents a potential security issue, given an operator
   may expect ULAs to be used when in practice RFC 1918 addresses are
   used instead.

   Operators should be mindful of cases where one node is compliant with
   RFC 6724 as originally published and another node is compliant with
   the update presented in this document, as there may be inconsistent
   behaviour for communications initiated in each direction.  Similarly,
   differences between current RFC 6724-compliant and RFC 3484-compliant
   nodes may also be observed.  Ultimately all nodes should be made
   compliant to the updated specification described in this document.

16.  IANA Considerations

   None.

17.  Appendix A.  Changes since RFC6724

   *  Update to default preference table moving 6to4 address block
      2002::/16 to de-preference status in line with [RFC7526],

   *  Change the default address selection to move fc00::/7 to
      preference 30, above legacy IPv4,

   *  Change ::ffff:0:0/96 to preference 20,

   *  Add section relating to Happy Eyeballs,

   *  Change section 5.5 to require interface prefix tracking.

   *  Note added for RFC 4193 ULA filtering as a MUST.

   *  Note added on RFC 4193 ULAs in the Global DNS as a MUST NOT.

         Preference for ULAs over RFC1918 addresses in RFC6724
                   draft-buraglio-6man-rfc6724-update

Abstract

   This document updates RFC6724 based on operational experience gained
   since its publication over ten years ago.  In particular it updates
   the preference of Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) in the default
   address selection policy table, which as originally defined by
   RFC6724 has lower precendence than legacy IPv4 addressing.  The
   update places both IPv6 Global Unicast Addresses (GUAs) and ULAs
   ahead of all IPv4 addresses on the policy table to better suit
   operational deployment and management of ULAs in production.  This
   document also updates requirements on configurability of the policy
   table and preference for using ddresses from a prefix advertised by a
   next-hop router, and demotes the preference for 6to4 addresses in the
   default policy table.

1.  Introduction

   ============

   When RFC6724 was published in 2012 it was expected that the default
   policy table may need to be updated from operartional experience;
   section 2.1 says "It is important that implementations provide a way
   to change the default policies as more experience is gained" and
   points to the expamples in Section 10, including Section 10.6 which
   considers a ULA example.

Internet-Draft  Preference for ULAs over RFC1918 address        May 2023


   This document is written on the basis of operational experience, in
   particular for scanerios where ULAs are used within a site.  The
   current default policy table in RFC6724 leads to preference for IPv6
   GUAs over IPv4 globals, which is widely considered to be preferential
   behaviour to support greater use of IPv6 in dual-stack environments,
   and to allow sites to phase out IPv4 as its use becomes ever lower.

   However, the default policy table also puts IPv6 ULAs below all IPv4
   addresses, including RFC 1918 addresses.  For many site operators
   this behavior will be counter intuitive, and may create difficulties
   with respect to planning, operational, and security implications for
   environments where ULA addressing is used in certain IPv4/IPv6 dual-
   stack network scenarios.  The expected prioritization of IPv6 traffic
   over IPv4 by default, as happens IPv6 GUA addressing, will not happen
   for ULAs.

   An IPv6 deployment, whether enterprise, residential or other, may use
   IPv6 GUAs, IPv6 ULAs, IPv4 globals, IPv4 RFC1918 addressing, and may
   or may not use some form of NAT.  This document makes no comment or
   recommendation on how ULAs are used, or on NAT, but notes that
   operationally where GUAs and ULAs are used alongside RFC1918
   addressing, an IPv6 GUA would be selected to reach an IPv6 GUA
   destination, but where only ULAs and RFC1918 addressing are used,
   RFC1918 addresses will be preferred.

   This document updates the default policy table to elevate the
   preference for ULAs such that ULAs will be preferred over all IPv4
   addresses, providing more consistent and less confusing behaviour for
   operators.

   This issue also highlights the need for the original RFC6724 address
   slection policy table to be configurable.  RFC6724 Section 2.1 states
   that the table SHOULD be configurable; this document proposes
   elevating that requirement to MUST, to ensure that any device can
   have its polict bale tuned for the scenario in which it is deployed.
   Section 10 of RFC6724 gives other examples of why configurability is
   important.

   It has also become clearer from operational experience that the
   heuristic to prefer addresses drawn from a prefix advertiused by a
   next-hop router is a valuable one to use.  This text therefore also
   proposes elevating that requirement in Section 5.5 from SHOULD to
   MUST.

   These updates are discussed in more detail in the following sections,
   with a further section providing a summary of the updates.

Internet-Draft  Preference for ULAs over RFC1918 address        May 2023


2.  Unintended Operational Issues Regarding IPv6 Preference and ULAs

   The preference for use of IPv6 addressing over IPv4 addressing in
   RFC6724 is inconsistent.  As written, RFC6724 section 10.3 states:

   "The default policy table gives IPv6 addresses higher precedence than
   IPv4 addresses.  This means that applications will use IPv6 in
   preference to IPv4 when the two are equally suitable.  An
   administrator can change the policy table to prefer IPv4 addresses by
   giving the ::ffff:0.0.0.0/96 prefix a higher precedence".

   The expected behavior would be that ULA address space would be
   preferred over legacy IPv4, however this is not the case.  This
   presents an issue with any environment that will use ULA addressing
   alongside legacy IPv4, whether global or RFC1918.  This is counter to
   the standard expectations for legacy IPv4 / IPv6 dual-stack behavior
   in preferring IPv6, which is the case for GUA addressing.

2.1.  Operational Implications

   There are demonstrated and easily repeatable uses cases of ULA not
   being preferred in some OS and network equipment over legacy IPv4
   that necessitate an update to RFC6724 to better reflect the original
   intent of the RFC.

   Below is an example of a gai.conf file from a modern Linux
   installation as of 25 May 2023:

# Configuration for getaddrinfo(3).
#
# So far only configuration for the destination address sorting is needed.
# RFC 3484 governs the sorting.  But the RFC also says that system
# administrators should be able to overwrite the defaults.  This can be
# achieved here.
#
# All lines have an initial identifier specifying the option followed by
# up to two values.  Information specified in this file replaces the
# default information.  Complete absence of data of one kind causes the
# appropriate default information to be used.  The supported commands include:
#
# reload  <yes|no>
#    If set to yes, each getaddrinfo(3) call will check whether this file
#    changed and if necessary reload.  This option should not really be
#    used.  There are possible runtime problems.  The default is no.
#
# label   <mask>   <value>
#    Add another rule to the RFC 3484 label table.  See section 2.1 in
#    RFC 3484.  The default is:

#
#label ::1/128       0
#label ::/0          1
#label 2002::/16     2
#label ::/96         3
#label ::ffff:0:0/96 4
#label fec0::/10     5
#label fc00::/7      6
#label 2001:0::/32   7
#
#    This default differs from the tables given in RFC 3484 by handling
#    (now obsolete) site-local IPv6 addresses and Unique Local Addresses.
#    The reason for this difference is that these addresses are never
#    NATed while IPv4 site-local addresses most probably are.  Given
#    the precedence of IPv6 over IPv4 (see below) on machines having only
#    site-local IPv4 and IPv6 addresses a lookup for a global address would
#    see the IPv6 be preferred.  The result is a long delay because the
#    site-local IPv6 addresses cannot be used while the IPv4 address is
#    (at least for the foreseeable future) NATed.  We also treat Teredo
#    tunnels special.
#
# precedence  <mask>   <value>
#    Add another rule to the RFC 3484 precedence table.  See section 2.1
#    and 10.3 in RFC 3484.  The default is:
#
#precedence  ::1/128       50
#precedence  ::/0          40
#precedence  2002::/16     30
#precedence ::/96          20
#precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  10
#
#    For sites which prefer IPv4 connections change the last line to
#
#precedence ::ffff:0:0/96  100

#
# scopev4  <mask>  <value>
#    Add another rule to the RFC 6724 scope table for IPv4 addresses.
#    By default the scope IDs described in section 3.2 in RFC 6724 are
#    used.  Changing these defaults should hardly ever be necessary.
#    The defaults are equivalent to:
#
#scopev4 ::ffff:169.254.0.0/112  2
#scopev4 ::ffff:127.0.0.0/104    2
#scopev4 ::ffff:0.0.0.0/96       14

Internet-Draft  Preference for ULAs over RFC1918 address        May 2023


   The legacy IPv4 address range in the gai.conf file is "scopev4" and
   the prefix ::ffff:0.0.0.0/96 which has a higher precedence (35) in
   RFC6724 than the ULA prefix of fc00::/7 (3).  This results in legacy
   IPv4 being preferred over IPv6 ULA.  While not inherently
   undesirable, the operational outcome when utilizing dual-stack with
   ULA is inconsistent and imparts unnecessary difficulty for both
   troubleshooting and creating the requisite baseline of the expected
   behavior which are both requirements for supportable production
   deployments.  Depending on the host implementation, security baseline
   expectations can be inconsistent at best and haphazard at worst.

   As the gai.conf file, or an equivalent within a given operating
   system, is referenced it dictates the behavior of the getaddrinfo()
   or analogous process.  More specifically, where getaddrinfo() or a
   comparable API is used, the sorting behavior should take into account
   both the source address of the requesting host as well as the
   destination addresses returned and sort according to both source and
   destination addresses, i.e, when a ULA address is returned, the
   source address selection should return and use a ULA address if
   available.  Similarly, if a GUA address is returned the source
   address selection should return a GUA source address if available.

   However, there are clearly evidenced example of failure scenarios:

   1.  ULA per RFC6724 is less preferred (the Precedence value is lower)
       than all legacy IPv4 (represented by ::ffff:0:0/96 in the
       aforementioned table).

   2.  Because of the lower Precedence value of fc00::/7, if a host has
       legacy IPv4 enabled, it will use legacy IPv4 before using ULA.

   3.  A dual-stacked client will source the traffic from the legacy
       IPv4 address, meaning it will require a corresponding legacy IPv4
       destination address.

   For scenario number 3, when a host resolves through DNS a destination
   with A and AAAA DNS records, the host will choose the A record to get
   an legacy IPv4 address for the destination, meaning ULA IPv6 is
   rendered unused.

   As a result, the use of ULAs is not a viable option for dual-stack
   networking transition planning, large scale network modeling, network
   lab environments or other modes of large scale networking that run
   both IPv4 and IPv6 concurrently with the expectation that IPv6 will
   be preferred by default.

3.  Configurability of the Default Policy Table

   In principle the above problem would not be an issue were the RFC6724
   default policy table readily configurable in all systems.
   Section 10.6 states that ULAs can be preferred by adding a site-
   specific entry to the default policy table.  In practice, this is
   currently not always possible.

   While conceptually the intent was for a configurable, longest-match
   table to be adjusted as needed.  In practice, modifying the prefix
   policy table remains difficult across platforms, and in some cases
   impossible.  Embedded, proprietary, closed source, and IoT devices
   are especially difficult to adjust, and are in many cases incapable
   of any adjustment.  Large scale manipulation of the policy table also
   remains out of the realm of realistic support for small and medium
   scale operators due to lack of ability to manipulate all the hosts
   and systems, or a lack of tooling and access.

   Operational experience suggests that the default policy table needs
   to be as configurable as possible in as many systems as possible.
   This update therefore proposes that the requirement that IPv6
   implementations support configurable address selection via a
   mechanism at least as powerful as the policy table be elevated from a
   SHOULD to a MUST.

   Authors' note for the -00 version: of course we state above that for
   some platforms, the ability to implement such a method is
   challenging.  The question for the 6man WG is how to ensure
   configurability is as widespread as possible.

4.  Next-hop router heuristic

   The heuristic for address selection defined in Section 5.5 of RFC6724
   to prefer addresses in a prefix advertised by a next-hop router has
   proven to be very useful.  RFC6724 does not state any requirement for
   SHOULD or MUST for this heuristic to be used; this update therefore
   proposes stating that the application of the heuristic be a MUST.

5.  Preference of 6to4 addresses

   The anycast prefix for 6to4 relays was deprecated by RFC7526 in 2015,
   and since that time the use of 6to4 addressing has further declined
   to the point where it is generally not seen and can be considered to
   all intents and purposes deprecated in use.  This document therefore
   demotes the preference of the 6to4 prefix in the policy table to the
   same minimum preference as carried by the deprecated site local and
   6bone address prefixes.

6.  Adjustments to RFC6724

   Rule 2.1 of RFC6724 states:

   IPv6 implementations SHOULD support configurable address selection
   via a mechanism at least as powerful as the policy tables defined
   here.  It is important that implementations provide a way to change
   the default policies as more experience is gained.  Sections 10.3
   through 10.7 provide examples of the kind of changes that might be
   needed.

   This document updates RFC6724 section 2.1 to the following:

IPv6 implementations MUST support configurable address selection
via a mechanism at least as powerful as the policy tables defined
here.  It is important that implementations provide a way to change
the default policies to ensure operational supportability and flexibility in deployment.
Sections 10.3 through 10.7 provide examples of the kind of changes that might be
needed.

   Rule 2.1 of RFC6724 further states:

 If an implementation is not configurable or has not been configured,
    then it SHOULD operate according to the algorithms specified here in
    conjunction with the following default policy table:


       Prefix        Precedence Label
       ::1/128               50     0
       ::/0                  40     1
       ::ffff:0:0/96         35     4
       2002::/16             30     2
       2001::/32              5     5
       fc00::/7               3    13
       ::/96                  1     3
       fec0::/10              1    11
       3ffe::/16              1    12

   This document updates RFC6724 section 2.1 to the following:

6.1.  needs labels adjusted

 If an implementation is not configurable or has not been configured,
    then it SHOULD operate according to the algorithms specified here in
    conjunction with the following default policy table:


       Prefix        Precedence Label
       ::1/128               50     0
       ::/0                  40     1
       fc00::/7              35    13
       ::ffff:0:0/96         30     4
       2001::/32              5     5
       2002::/16              1     2
       ::/96                  1     3
       fec0::/10              1    11
       3ffe::/16              1    12

   This preference table update moves 2002::/16 to de-preference status
   in line with RFC7526 and changes the default address selection to
   move fc00::/7 above legacy IPv4, changing ::ffff:0:0/96 to preference
   30.

   Rule 5.5 of RFC6724 states:

  Rule 5.5: Prefer addresses in a prefix advertised by the next-hop.
  If SA or SA's prefix is assigned by the selected next-hop that will
  be used to send to D and SB or SB's prefix is assigned by a different
  next-hop, then prefer SA.  Similarly, if SB or SB's prefix is
  assigned by the next-hop that will be used to send to D and SA or
  SA's prefix is assigned by a different next-hop, then prefer SB.
  Discussion: An IPv6 implementation is not required to remember
  which next-hops advertised which prefixes.  The conceptual models
  of IPv6 hosts in Section 5 of [](RFC4861) and Section 3 of [](RFC4191)
  have no such requirement.  Hence, Rule 5.5 is only applicable to
  implementations that track this information.

   This document updates RFC6724 section 5.5 to the following:

Rule 5.5: Hosts MUST prefer addresses in a prefix advertised by the next-hop.
If SA or SA's prefix is assigned by the selected next-hop that will
be used to send to D and SB or SB's prefix is assigned by a different
next-hop, then prefer SA.  Similarly, if SB or SB's prefix is
assigned by the next-hop that will be used to send to D and SA or
SA's prefix is assigned by a different next-hop, then prefer SB.
Discussion: An IPv6 implementation is not required to remember
which next-hops advertised which prefixes.  The conceptual models
of IPv6 hosts in Section 5 of [](RFC4861) and Section 3 of [](RFC4191)
have no such requirement.  Hence, Rule 5.5 is only applicable to
implementations that track this information.

7.  The practicalities of implementing address selection support

   As with most adjustments to standards, and using RFC6724 itself as a
   measurement, the updates defined in this document will likely take
   between 8-20 years to become common enough for consistent behavior
   within most operating systems.  At the time of writing, it has been
   over 10 years since RFC6724 has been published but we continue to see
   existing commercial and open source operating systems exhibiting
   RFC3484 behavior.

   While it should be noted that RFC6724 defines a solution that is
   functional theoretically, operationally the solution of adjusting the
   address preference selection table is both operating system dependent
   and unable to be signaled by any network mechanism such as within a
   router advertisement or DHCPv6 option (while RFC7078 defines such a
   DHCPv6 option, it is not by any means widely implemented).  This lack
   of an intra-protocol or network-based ability to adjust address
   selection preference, along with the inability to adjust a notable
   number of operating systems either programmatically or manually
   renders operational scalability of such a mechanism challenging.

   It is especially important to note this behavior in the long
   lifecycle equipment that exists in industrial control and operational
   technology environments due to their very long mean time to
   replacement/lifecycle.

   In practice this means that network operators and those who design
   networks need to keep these considerations in mind.  One workaround
   should the ULA and IPv4 preference issue be of concern is to use
   IPv6-only networking, and to simply not deploy dual-stack.  Another
   is to use GUA IPv6 addresses, which are preferred by defaul over all
   IPv4 addresses.

   The IETF documents referred to here are RFC2119 and I-D.ietf-core-
   coap.  We also refer to REST (REST).  a-rose and exampleTable are
   explicitly tagged, as is refstyle, but security-considerations is
   implicit.  The web page at ipv.sx (http://ipv.sx/) is not part of
   this document.

10.  Security Considerations

   There are no direct security considerations in this document.

   The mixed preference for IPv6 over IPv4 from the default policy table
   in RFC6724 represents a potential security issue, given an operator
   may expect ULAs to be used when in practice RFC1918 addresses are
   used instead.

   When using the updated ULA source address selection defined in this
   document, network operators must follow Section 4.3 of RFC4193 for
   firewall/packet filtering as "routers be configured by default to
   keep any packets with Local IPv6 addresses from leaking outside of
   the site and to keep any site prefixes from being advertised outside
   of their site."  Following this security practice is critical when
   ULAs have more broad reachability.

11.  IANA Considerations

   None.

12.  Appendix A.  Changes since RFC6724

   *  Update to default preference table moving 6to4 address block
      2002::/16 to de-preference status in line with RFC7526

   *  Change the default address selection to move fc00::/7 to
      preference 35, above legacy IPv4,

   *  Change ::ffff:0:0/96 to preference 30. \

   *  Change section 5.5 Prefer addresses in a prefix advertised by the
      next-hop to a MUST
